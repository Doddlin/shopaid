  covid: "COVID 19 came and took the world with storm. However, since it is affecting some groups more than others, this initiative came up."
  riskgroup: "To help high risk people this site will collect their needs shopping-wise and you who do not belong to that same group can assign a list to you and go shop - helping others help others!"
  riskgroup2: "Furthermore this website will make it easy for people that are in need of help but not necessarily very comfortable online to get the help they need."
